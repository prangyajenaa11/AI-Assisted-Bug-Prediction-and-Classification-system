### **Project Title:** AI-Assisted Bug Prediction and Classification System

**Description:**

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting and classifying software bugs based on historical data and code metrics. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, the system provides developers with invaluable insights to proactively address potential issues, enhancing software quality and reducing development costs.

**Key Features:**

- **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Gathers a diverse range of code metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, function calls) and bug reports, ensuring a rich dataset for model training.
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing:** Employs sophisticated techniques to clean, normalize, and handle missing data, ensuring data quality and consistency for optimal model performance.
- **Cutting-Edge Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) to accurately classify bugs and predict their likelihood.
- **Robust Model Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluates model performance using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to ensure reliability and effectiveness.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Provides an intuitive web-based interface for developers to interact with the system, easily input code metrics, and receive accurate bug predictions.

**Technologies:**

- **Python:** A versatile programming language for data analysis, machine learning, and web development.
- **scikit-learn:** A powerful machine learning library for building and training models.
- **pandas:** A high-performance data analysis library for data manipulation and exploration.
- **numpy:** A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python.
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for building web applications.
